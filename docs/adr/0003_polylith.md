Date: 2022/01/10

## Status

__Accepted__

## Context

Polylith has been selected as the architecture to move forward for all future Eval-Tools based development.

## Decisions

Polylith architecture has proven to be useful, modular, and flexible. The decision to make all future commits to this repository use the Polylith/interface architecture has been enacted.

## Consequences

Restructuring of the repository into components, bases, and projects has been completed. New components have been created to support additional experimentation without incident.
