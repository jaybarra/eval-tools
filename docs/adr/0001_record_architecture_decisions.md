# 0001 Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2021-07-15

## Status

__accepted__

## Context

Needed to put down architechtural thoughts and decisions made for this project. Eval Tools is now large enough that external brain is required.

## Decisions

We will use Architechture Decision Records as described by Micheal Nygard. New ADRs will be created to describe components of the architecture.

## Consequences

A new ADR folder was created to hold ADR records.
